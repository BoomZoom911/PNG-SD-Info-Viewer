# PNG-SD-Info-Viewer

PNG-SD-Info-Viewer is a program designed to quickly allow the browsing of PNG files with associated metadata from Stable Diffusion generated images.

There were a lot of web-based tools to do this, and even extensions for popular SD repositories, but I didn't see anything lightweight that was a native Windows program.
So I whipped this up and decided to post it here. :)  Uses the GNU GPL3 license so you can use it, too. :)



Uses, and thanks to, the <a href="https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor">metadata-extractor library</a> developed by Drew Noakes under <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">the Apache License 2</a>
