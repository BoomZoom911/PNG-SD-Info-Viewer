# PNG-SD-Info-Viewer

PNG-SD-Info-Viewer is a program designed to quickly allow the browsing of PNG files with associated metadata from Stable Diffusion generated images.

There were a lot of web-based tools to do this, and even extensions for popular SD repositories, but I didn't see anything lightweight that was a native Windows program.
So I whipped this up and decided to post it here. :)  Uses the GNU GPL3 license so you can use it, too. :)

Features:
 - Quick image viewing
 - List view, or image preview view
 - Resizable window
 - Image fit-to-box, or full-size views, with image panning
 - Quick "tagging" to help cull favorite images.  Tags are stored in memory only, and do NOT affect the files.
 - Quick "copy to folder" function to save all your favorites to a new folder
 - Scrollwheel use to move quickly between images
 - View full generation metadata from images and quickly copy to clipboard
